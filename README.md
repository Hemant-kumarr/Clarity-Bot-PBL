<h3>ClarityBot – AI Life Guidance Assistant</h3>
By: Hemant Kumar

ClarityBot is a smart and friendly AI web app I created to help students like me who feel confused, stuck, or unsure about their future. It gives clear, step-by-step advice based on what you’re feeling, what you like, your goals, and more.

What It Does
You just fill a simple form with things like:
What you’re studying and interested in
Your hobbies and skills you want to learn
How you’re feeling or what problems you’re facing
Your short goals and big dreams
Achievements and strengths
Social life and energy levels

Based on this, ClarityBot gives:
A kind message about what you’ve done
5–7 simple steps to help you move forward
A small question to think about
A helpful link or resource to start right away
Friendly and motivating words in simple English

Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
AI Engine: Google Gemini Pro API
Design: Mobile-first, smooth, and clean
Extras: Animations, good UX, fast and responsive

Why I Made It
I’ve seen many students (including me) feel lost sometimes — not knowing what to do next. So I made ClarityBot to give real, positive guidance using AI — like a supportive friend who helps you find direction.

ClarityBot is more than a tool — it’s my way of helping students feel clear, confident, and ready for life.
